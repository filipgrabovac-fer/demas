- add Tavily as a search tool for enhancer which he can use on demand
- check if parallelization is possible and takes a normal amount of time to implement
- check with mentor if FER can pay for the credits

- add support for JSON objects and add JSON chunker
    -> create a universal API for data chunkers that have JSON and CSV options

- add support for generic types
    -> generate a specific type from CSV headers and JSON objects
- potential issues with dynamic types:
    -> JSON data that doesn't have consistent structure (missing properties, different values)
    -> CSV without headers
